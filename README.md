# GenomicWidgets

The GenomicWidgets packages enables making interactive plots for genomics. It builds off the [iheatmapr package](https:://github.com/ropensci/iheatmapr) to provide methods for making interactive heatmaps tailored for functional genomics assays and using as input Bioconductor's SummarizedExperiment data format.  The package also has functionality for making interactive genome track plots, as well as shiny apps that link heatmap rows to associated genome track plots.
